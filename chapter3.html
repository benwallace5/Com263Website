							<h4 style="text-align:center">The Relationship Between Communication and Context </h4>
							<p class="indent">The circumstances that form a setting for interactions are the context. These circumstances can be physical or social characteristics of what is happening surrounding an interaction. Context is vital when it comes to understanding communication because it affects how information is understood. One example of a political context that is necessary for understanding communication is George Floyd’s protestors yelling “I can’t breathe” which is in response to policemen choking Floyd to death. Without knowing the political and societal context of a situation like this, it is impossible to fully understand the intercultural communication that is occurring.
								</p>
										<h4 style="text-align:center">The Relationship Between Power and Communication. </h4>
							<p class="indent">Power is another aspect that influences communication, even though it is not greatly understood how it does. It has been shown throughout history, that those in power promote/push
								not only their political views but also their communication systems that reflect their ideas. When it comes to power, there are two dimensions, a primary and secondary dimension.
								The primary dimension is related to permanent aspects of a group, such as age, gender, or race and the secondary dimension is concerned with less permanent aspects such as education,
								physical location, and socio-economic status. Overall, the communication systems which come with power hinder those who do not perform well in those systems, such as a system that values
								public speaking and someone who is not comfortable with public speaking.
