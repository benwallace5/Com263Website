							<h4 style="text-align:center">Antecedents of contact </h4>
							<p class="indent">One way in which history affects communication is through an individual’s past encounters that influence a present situation. It has been found that
								the first historical encounter people bring to interactions is their childhood experiences. For example, if someone grew up with parents who dislike a particular
								group of people and have influenced their child with this view, this will have an effect on their interaction with a said group if they encounter them later in their
								life. Another influence in intercultural communication is language. Language can have a positive or negative effect on someone’s first impression. For example, many
								Americans find the Russian language to be more intimidating which can negatively affect an interaction.
								</p>
										<h4 style="text-align:center">The Contact Hypothesis </h4>
							<p class="indent">The contact hypothesis is widely found in United States public policies and programs. This hypothesis states in order to reduce prejudice and increase
								 intergroup attitude, groups must be brought together and must interact. An example of this is desegregation in the United States to remove racism and prejudice between
								  two groups by allowing them to interact. Scholars have produced conditions that when met, improve intergroup interactions. For example, one of these conditions is that
									the two groups must voluntarily meet because research has shown that two groups forced to interact does not result in a positive outcome. Another condition is group members
									 should share some values in order to find some common ground between different groups.
