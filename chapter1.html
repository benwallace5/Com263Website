							</header>
							<p> Studying intercultural communication raises awareness. Not only does it raise awareness about other cultures, but it is found that intercultural communication makes people more aware of their own culture and background.</p>
							<h4>The Demographic Imperative</h4>
							<p>An increase in diversity means an increase in intercultural encounters. This is especially apparent in the United States, where demographics are changing rapidly. The 2010 U.S Census revealed that caucasian numbers are growing slower than that of racial and ethnic minorities. This directly correlates to an increase in diversity in the workplace. One of the leading causes for the demographic change in the United States is immigration, which has always been a major part of this country. The more immigration, the more diversity. Diversity is very important to society. Research shows that when various cultures and ways of life converge, it increases creativity, productivity, and much more. </p>
							<h4>The Technological Imperative</h4>
							<p>The internet provides people with a form of communication unlike any other. People can communicate across the world, with someone they may never meet face to face with, which increases the amount of intercultural communication. It also gives everyone access to information about the world. While technology opens up new avenues to communicate, there are also many downsides. One may think that all the information available online about other cultures would decrease the amount of societal conflict, however, it has had the opposite effect on societies. This is because people tend to only consume information that follows their views. Another downside is hate speech. The internet gives people an easy, anonymous platform to state their opinion and many take advantage of this to push their racist agenda. Along with hate speech, the internet is also plagued with misinformation because anyone can post anything at any time for the world to see.</p>
