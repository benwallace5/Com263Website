						<h4 style="text-align:center">The Early Development of Intercultural communication </h4>
						<p class="indent">The study of intercultural communication began after World War II, when America began to become the powerful nation it is today. However, people from the United States traveling overseas
							for business realized they were not prepared to communicate and create relations with people from different cultures. In return, the government passed legislation and set up the Foreign Service
							Institute in 1946. The FSI began training overseas workers and had to develop new methods of studying intercultural communication since it had never been done before. </p>
						<h4 style="text-align:center"> Three Approaches to Studying Intercultural Communication</h4>
						<p class="indent"> The social science approach is based on research in the fields of psychology and sociology. Researchers are attempting to predict and describe the behavior of intercultural communication
							because this approach views culture as a measurable variable. With this approach, they are trying to determine how culture influences communication. The second approach is the interpretive approach,
							which is more concerned with understanding human behavior. In contrast to the social science approach, the interpretive approach believes culture is developed and continued through communication. The
							third approach, the critical approach, carries over many theories from the interpretive approach. However, they are more interested in the macrocontexts, which are social, political, and historical contexts
							that affect communication.
